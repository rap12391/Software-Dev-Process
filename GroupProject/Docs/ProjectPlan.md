# Project Plan

**Version: 3.0**

**Author**: Team 09

## 1 Introduction


The purpose of this project is to build a mobile application for students to practice vocabulary quizzes.

## 2 Process Description

**Phase 1: Inception and Elaboration**

- Activity: Develop initial design considerations
- Activity description: The team will develop initial design considerations in regards to the software being used, system environment, and operational environment
- Entrance criteria: Project brief (deliverable documents 1 & 2)
- Exit criteria: Begin a design document which includes the initial design considerations  

---

- Activity: Define system architecture
- Activity description: Identify the main components in the application and how the interact with each other and with hardware. Each component should represent a cluster of related functionality
- Entrance criteria: Project brief and initial design document
- Exit criteria: Added component and deployment diagrams within the design document  

---

- Activity: Define low level design
- Activity description: Develop documentation for low-level design of system components. The purpose here is to describe the structure of the system being built. The output should define how the system is built and should model programmable code
- Entrance criteria: Initial component and deployment diagrams, project brief
- Exit criteria: Class diagram within the design document  

---

- Activity: Define use cases
- Activity description: The purpose of this activity is to define potential use cases of the application. The use cases will provide viable scenarios that can be executed after application launch. The use cases should define requirements, pre-conditions, post-conditions, and scenarios for actions a user may perform
- Entrance criteria: Project brief, design document
- Exit criteria: Use case diagram and supporting explanation text  

---

- Activity: Define test plan
- Activity description: Develop a test plan about unit, integration, system, and regression testing strategies. The test plan should clearly identify testing methodology for the system and how it will test the platform structurally and functionally.
- Entrance criteria: Use case model, design document
- Exit criteria: Test plan document with test cases  

---

- Activity: Create initial design
- Activity description: Create visual mockups of the applications user interface. The interface should support all the functionality highlighted in the design brief. 
- Entrance criteria: Design brief (deliverable documents 1 & 2)
- Exit criteria: Visual mock-ups of application screens  

---

**Phase 2: Construction**

- Activity: Vocabulary Quiz App (v1.0)
- Activity description: Build the working prototype of the application. In doing so, the team should reference all documents created in phase 1 to make sure all requirements are met. The interface should reference the interface mockup, and the backend code should reference the design document. The use case diagram and test plan should also be used to verify design decisions.
- Entrance criteria: Use case diagram, test plan, interface mockup, design brief
- Exit criteria: Semi-functioning prototype, all functionality will not be built, but enough to test a few of the inital test cases. Skeletons should exist for every class and UI pages must be completed. 

---

- Activity: Testing v1.0
- Activity description: Test the application based off of the test criteria defined during test planning. Team will test against test cases and update the cases if necessary. Application enhancements and bugs should also be tracked.
- Entrance criteria: Test case document, Vocabulary Quiz App v1.0
- Exit criteria: An application which passes some of the test cases depending on implemented functionality, updated test case document  

---

- Activity: Develop user manual
- Activity description: Develop a user manual which describes the usage and important features of the application to the end user. 
- Entrance criteria: Vocabulary Quiz App v1.0, use case document
- Exit criteria: md file called UserManual.md  

---

**Phase 3: Transition**

- Activity: Vocabulary Quiz App v2.0
- Activity description: Modify working prototype to fit all criteria previously defined and new criteria based off of v1.0.
- Entrance criteria: Vocabulary Quiz App v1.0, use case document
- Exit criteria: Vocabulary Quiz App v2.0

---

- Activity: Testing (v2.0)
- Activity description: Test the final version of the quiz application against old and new test cases. Track application enhancements and fix all bugs mentioned in the first build. 
- Entrance criteria: Test case document, Vocabulary Quiz App v2.0
- Exit criteria: Application which passes all previous test cases. Updated test case document.

---

- Activity: Documentation Revision
- Activity description: Update all documentation related to the application so that they are reflective of the newest version of the app. This includes test cases, use case diagrams, class diagrams, component diagrams, UI diagrams, and related material.
- Entrance criteria: Design document, test case document, use case document
- Exit criteria: New version of the documents mentioned in the entrance criteria.
