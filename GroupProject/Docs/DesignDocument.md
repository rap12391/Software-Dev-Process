# Design Document

**Version: 3.0**

This design document describes a mobile app for students to practice taking vocabulary quizzes.

**Author**: Team 09

## 1 Design Considerations

### 1.1 Assumptions
#### Further assumptions about the background
* The vocabulary words can belong to any knowledge domain so there are no validation for the words that can be added to the quizzes. Further refinements should be considered about sensitive words and definitions that can cause an uncomfortable user experience when taking quizzes created by other students.

#### Dependencies of the software
* The app runs exclusively on Android
* Data generated by the app needs to be persisted locally, so when the app is restarted, the users can retrieve all previous data. SQLite will be used through the Room Persistent Library.
* Data does not need to be stored remotely, e.g. a server, so a client-server implementation is not required.

#### Software use assumptions
* Only one student can use the app at a given time. If another student wants to use the same app, the previous student should either conclude their practice session
* Unfinished Practice Sessions should not be saved.
* If a user stops the app during a Practice Session, this should not be saved.

#### Operational environment
* Android operates in a vast range of phone specs. On the higher end, phones with 126GB storage and 6GB of RAM, such as the Samsung Galaxy S9. However, on the lower spec end, there are smartphones in the market with 8GB storage and 512MB RAM. In the context of the Vocabulary Quiz app, it might affect the maximum number of students, quizzes and scores that can be stored. Furthermore, the App should run in any of these environments. A reasonable assumption is to use the flagship phones provided by Google: Android/Pixel, platform in which all new features are first beta tested under those specs before any release. In addition, even though the most recent phone is the Pixel 2, the Nexus 5 has past the test of time as the go-to development phone, therefore a Virtual Environment with an image of this phone should suffice.
* The application does not have CPU-bound operations, therefore it is assumed that any smartphone in the market should comfortably be able to run the App without detectable lags.

#### Project issues
* The team is spread across 3 time zones (PT/ET/GMT). Communication platforms are key for the team to interact and collaborate. The following platforms were set:
* WhatsApp/email for general communications
* Google Docs to brainstorm design ideas
* Google Meet for videoconferencing and sync up
* Github to commit each individual’s contributions to the project.

### 1.2 Constraints

#### System constraints.
* Data, file storage, and memory allocation: There aren’t any requirements about the system constraints of these elements. However, some assumptions were made about how much storage this app should use in section 1.1
* Since one of the technical requirements states that the minimum API level for the app should be Level 23, some of the Java 8 features cannot be used, namely Optional, Lambdas, Objects and the newer methods in Collections.

#### Time constraints.
* A first version of the project should be released by October 12.
* A final version should be released by October 19.

#### Infrastructure constraints
* The app should be developed either in hardware belonging to of each of the team members or using CoC hardware.
* The app should be developed using Android Studio.

### 1.3 System Environment

The system must operate in Android compatible platforms, such as Nexus, Samsung Galaxy, LG, etc. To verify the system environment, an emulator provided by the IDE Android Studio will be used.

## 2 Architectural Design

### 2.1 Component Diagram
The application contains all activities and classes embedded into the same package, so it monolithic. Also, it doesn’t contain a sufficient level of complexity to merit a component diagram as per the definition. However, it was important to map the dependencies between the different UI views, the main application parts, and the persistent layer. The following diagram shows such relationships.

### 2.2 Deployment Diagram
The following simplified deployment diagram shows how the app is currently deployed to the emulator

A deployment diagram is more important in cases where:
* The app rolls out in stages to multiple users using a third-party server, e.g. the Google Play store.
* Rollouts happen in different geographic locations and in multiple servers/devices.
