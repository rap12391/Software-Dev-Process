# Test Plan

**Version 3.0**

**Author**: Team 09

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

All bulk of the testing will be done via black box testing. Black box testing involves testing without knowing the inner functions of a module. Junit tests will also be implemented to test requirements. 

### 1.2 Test Selection


Test cases are derived from system requirements. Black-box testing will be performed with emphasis on system Black-box testing which involves identifying requirements, deriving what features could be tested, and then generating test cases for each of those requirements.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion


Statement coverage will be performed by checking if the test cases have sufficiently hit most parts of the implementation.

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*
Bugs and enhancements will be track by using the issues feature in github. Using that tool will allow members on the team to post issues/enhancements that can then be reassigned to other members for fixes.

Bugs and enhancements will be tracked by using issues in Github. Team members will be able to submit different issues to it which can then be resolved by the same team member or other individuals on the team.

### 1.5 Technology


JUnit will be used to test the application. JUnit can also be used with  the Espresso API to test the actual graphical user interface.
